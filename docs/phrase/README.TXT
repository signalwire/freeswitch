What are these files?

These files outline the various phrases used in the mod_say_xx.c modules. 
Most of these will require matching mod_say_xx.c files to actually use along
with the recorded sound files in the various languages.  phrase.pl can be used
to automatically generate or verify all the files exist for a particular 
language.  If you are capable of recording each language please do so and
contribute them to the project.  As phrases are added, the files will need to be
updated for the respective phrase_xx.xml file.
make_checks.sh - script to compare phrase_en.xml with other language xml files.
Script output contains prompt elements with attributes:
translated - value 'false' or not displayed;
translated-to - translation value if exists;
more-then-one-translation - displayed if exist two or more for given wav file.

How can you contribute?

You can contribute via patches posted to the mailing list or at 
https://freeswitch.org/jira, if possible please record the sound files
for testing.  We also need voicemail_xx.xml macros updated for each language.

Thanks,
