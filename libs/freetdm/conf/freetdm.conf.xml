This is a sample FreeSWITCH XML configuration for FreeTDM
Remember you still need to configure freetdm.conf (no XML extension) in $prefix/conf/
directory of FreeSWITCH. The freetdm.conf (no XML extension) is a simple text file
definining the I/O interfaces (Sangoma, DAHDI etc). This file (freetdm.conf.xml) deals
with the signaling protocols that you can run on top of your I/O interfaces.

 	openr2 (MFC-R2 signaling) spans (ftmod_r2)
	
	In order to use this type of spans your FreeTDM must have been compiled with ftmod_r2 module.
	The module is compiled if the openr2 library is present when running the ./configure script
	in the FreeTDM source code

	MFC-R2 signaling has lots of variants from country to country and even sometimes
	minor variants inside the same country. The only mandatory parameters here are:
	variant, but typically you also want to set max_ani and max_dnis.
	IT IS RECOMMENDED that you leave the default values (leaving them commented) for the 
	other parameters unless you have problems or you have been instructed to change some 
	parameter. OpenR2 library uses the 'variant' parameter to try to determine the 
	best defaults for your country.  If you want to contribute your configs for a particular 
	country send them to the e-mail of the primary OpenR2 developer that you can find in the 
	AUTHORS file of the OpenR2 package, they will be added to the samples directory of openr2.

			Brazil uses a special calling party category for collect calls (llamadas por cobrar)
			instead of using the operator (as in Mexico). The R2 spec in Brazil says a special GB tone
			should be used to reject collect calls. If you want to ALLOW collect calls specify 'yes',
			if you want to BLOCK collect calls then say 'no'. Default is to block collect calls.
			(see also 'double_answer')
			<param name="allow_collect_calls" value="yes"/>
			-->

			<!--
			This feature is related but independent of allow_collect_calls
			Some PBX's require a double-answer process to block collect calls, if
			you ever have problems blocking collect calls using Group B signals (allow_collect_calls=no)
			then you may want to try with double_answer=yes, this will cause that every answer signal
			is changed to perform 'answer -> clear back -> answer' (sort of a flash)
			(see also 'allow_collect_calls')
			<param name="double_answer" value="yes"/>

			<!--
			Brazil use a special signal to force the release of the line (hangup) from the
			backward perspective. When forced_release=no, the normal clear back signal
			will be sent on hangup, which is OK for all mfcr2 variants I know of, except for
			Brazilian variant, where the central will leave the line up for several seconds (30, 60)
			which sometimes is not what people really want. When forced_release=yes, a different
			signal will be sent to hangup the call indicating that the line should be released immediately
			<param name="forced_release" value="yes"/>

			This setting has no effect with most telecos, usually is safe

			<!--
			MFC/R2 value in milliseconds for the metering pulse timeout.
			Metering pulses are sent by some telcos for some R2 variants
			during a call presumably for billing purposes to indicate costs,
			however this pulses use the same signal that is used to indicate
			call hangup, therefore a timeout is sometimes required to distinguish
			between a *real* hangup and a billing pulse that should not
			last more than 500ms, If you experience call drops after some
			minutes of being stablished try setting a value of some ms here,
			values greater than 500ms are not recommended.
			BE AWARE that choosing the proper protocol variant parameter
			implicitly sets a good recommended value for this timer, use this
			parameter only when you *really* want to override the default, otherwise
			just comment out this value.
