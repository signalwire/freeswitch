spandsp 0.0.5 - A DSP library for telephony
-------------------------------------------

SpanDSP is a library of DSP functions for telephony, in the 8000 sample per
second world of E1s, T1s, and higher order PCM channels. It contains low level
functions, such as basic filters. It also contains higher level functions, such
as cadenced supervisory tone detection, and a complete software FAX machine.
The software has been designed to avoid intellectual property issues, using
mature techniques where all relevant patents have expired. See the file
DueDiligence for important information about these intellectual property issues.

The library is licenced under the LGPL 2.1 licence. The test suite, and some support
programs are licenced under the GPL 2 licence. The full text of these licences can
be found in the file COPYING.

Dependencies
------------

spandsp depends on various other packages for various tasks. Most of these
dependencies relate to building the test suite.

libtiff (and libtiff-devel on most Linux distributions) is required to
build the spandsp library.

libaudiofile (and libaudiofile-devel) is required to build the test suite
fftw (and fftw-devel) is required to build the test suite. Version 2 or 3 of
FFTW may be used. Spandsp adapts to the differences between them.

fltk (and fltk-devel), Fl_Cartesian and Fl_Audio_Meter are required to build
the test suite with GUI interfaces for some of the tests. The tests will build
without these packages, but the GUI features will not be available.
Fl_Cartesian and Fl_Audio_Meter can be downloaded from
http://www.soft-switch.org/downloads.
