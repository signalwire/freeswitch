tpl ChangeLog
=============

Version 1.5 (2010-02-05)
--------------------------
* tpl now builds as a DLL under Microsoft Visual Studio! (thanks, degski and Zhang Yafei!)
* there are now two download options: the http://downloads.sourceforge.net/tpl/libtpl-1.5.tar.bz2[tarball] and the Visual Studio http://downloads.sourceforge.net/tpl/tpl-1.5-vs2008.zip[solution] 
* a crash in `tpl_free` on certain format strings has been fixed (thanks, Eric Rose!)
* fixed a bug in `tpl_dump` on 64-bit, big-endian platforms
* changed some pointer casts from `long` to `uintptr_t` since 64-bit Windows has 32-bit longs
* tpl has been downloaded 4,195 times.


Version 1.4 (2009-04-21)
--------------------------
* fixed-length arrays can now be multi-dimensional like `i##`
* fixed-length string arrays like `s#` are now supported
* nested structures can now be expressed, using the dollar symbol, e.g. `S(ci$(cc))`
* `tpl_dump` can use a caller-allocated output buffer (`TPL_MEM|TPL_PREALLOCD`)
* `tpl_load` can tolerate excess space in input buffer (`TPL_MEM|TPL_EXCESS_OK`)
* implement `TPL_FXLENS` flag for `tpl_peek` to get lengths of fixed-length arrays
* implement `TPL_GETSIZE` flag for `tpl_dump` to get dump size without dumping
* fix success return code from `tpl_dump(TPL_FD,...)` (thanks, Max Lapan!)
* deprecated the wildcard unpacking `S(*)` feature
