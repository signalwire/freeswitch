Overview

Serialization in C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tpl is a library for serializing C data. The data is stored in its natural
binary form. The API is small and tries to stay "out of the way". 
Tpl can serialize many C data types, including structures.

Uses for tpl
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tpl makes a convenient file format. For example, suppose a program needs to
store a list of user names and ids. This can be expressed using the format
string `A(si)`.  If the program needs two such lists (say, one for regular
users and one for administrators) this could be expressed as `A(si)A(si)`. It
is easy to read and write this kind of structured data using tpl.

Tpl can also be used as an IPC message format. It handles byte order issues
and deframing individual messages off of a stream automatically.

Expressing type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The "data type" of a tpl is explicitly stated as a format string. There is
never any ambiguity about the type of data stored in a tpl.  Some examples:

* `A(is)` is a variable-length array of integer-string pairs
* `A(is)A(is)` are two such arrays, completely independent of one another
* `S(ci)` is a structure containing a char and integer
* `S(ci)#` is a fixed-length array of the latter structure
* `A(A(i))` is a nested array, that is, an array of integer arrays

The tpl image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A tpl image is the serialized form of a tpl, stored in a memory buffer or file,
or written to a file descriptor.

What's in a tpl image?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is no need to understand the internal structure of the tpl image. But for the
curious, the image is a strictly defined binary buffer having two sections, 
a header and the data.  The header encodes the length of the image, its
format string, endian order and other flags. The data section contains the
packed data. 

No framing needed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A property of the tpl image is that consecutive images can be written to a stream
without requiring any delimiter between them. The reader making use of 
`tpl_gather` (or `tpl_load` in `TPL_FD` mode) will obtain exactly one tpl image at 
a time.  Therefore tpl images can be used as an IPC message format without any
higher-level framing protocol. 

Data portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A tpl image generated on one kind of CPU will generally be portable to other
CPU types when tpl is used properly. This may be a surprise considering that 
tpl is a binary format. But tpl has been carefully designed to make this work.
Each <<types,format character>> has an associated explicitly-sized type. For 
integer and floating point types, whose "endian" or byte-order convention varies
from one CPU to another, tpl automatically and transparently corrects the
endian order (if needed) during the unpacking process.  Floating point numbers
present their own <<trouble_with_double,special difficulties>>. 'No guarantees
are made with regard to floating point portability.' That said, because many
modern CPU's use IEEE 754 floating point representation, data is likely to be
portable among them. 

XML and Perl
~~~~~~~~~~~~
'Note: The `tplxml` utility and the Perl module are currently unsupported in tpl 1.5.'

XML
^^^
While a tpl image is a binary entity, you can view any tpl image in XML format
using the included `tplxml` utility, located in the `lang/perl` directory. 

    tplxml file.tpl > file.xml
    tplxml file.xml > file.tpl

The utility is bidirectional, as shown.  The file extension is not important;
`tplxml` inspects its input to see if it's tpl or XML. You can also pipe data
into it instead of giving it a filename. The `tplxml` utility is slow. Its
purpose is two-fold: debugging (manual inspection of the data in a tpl), and
interoperability with XML-based programs.  The resulting XML is often ten times
the size of the original binary tpl image.

Perl 
^^^^
There is a Perl module in `lang/perl/Tpl.pm`. The link:perl.html[Perl API] 
is convenient for writing Perl scripts that interoperate with C programs, and
need to pass structured data back and forth. It is written in pure Perl. 

Platforms
~~~~~~~~~
The tpl software was developed for POSIX systems and has been tested on 32- and 64-bit
platforms including:

 * Linux 
 * Solaris 
 * Mac OS X 
 * OpenBSD 
 * Windows using Visual Studio 2008 or 2010, or Cygwin or MinGW

Build and install
-----------------

Tpl has no dependencies on libraries other than the system C library. You
can simply copy the tpl source into your project, so you have no dependencies.
Alternatively, you can build tpl as a library and link it to your program.

As source
~~~~~~~~~
The simplest way to use tpl is to copy the source files `tpl.h` and `tpl.c`
(from the `src/` directory) right into your project, and build them with the
rest of your source files. No special compiler flags are required. 

As a library
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alternatively, to build tpl as a library, from the top-level directory, run:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

This installs a static library `libtpl.a` and a shared library (e.g.,
`libtpl.so`), if your system supports them, in standard places. The installation
directory can be customized using `./configure --prefix=/some/directory`. Run
`configure --help` for further options.

Test suite
^^^^^^^^^^
You can compile and run the built-in test suite by running:
    
    cd tests/
    make

On Windows
~~~~~~~~~~

DLL
^^^
On the tpl home page, a Visual Studio 2008 solution package is available for
download.  This zip file contains pre-built 32- and 64-bit versions of tpl as a
DLL.  If you like, you can build the DLL yourself using  VS2008 or VS2010 (the
free Express Edition is sufficient) by opening the solution file and choosing
Build Solution. 

Non-DLL usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Alternatively, tpl can be used directly (instead of as a DLL) by compiling
the tpl sources right into your program. To do this, add `tpl.c`, `tpl.h`,
`win/mman.h` and `win/mmap.c` to your program's source and header files and 
add the preprocessor definition `TPL_NOLIB`.

MinGW/Cygwin
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Prior to tpl release 1.5, using tpl on Windows required building it with MinGW
or Cygwin. This is no longer necessary. If you want to build it that way anyway,
use the non-Windows (i.e. tar.bz2) tpl download and follow the "configure; make;
make install" approach.

API concepts
------------
To use tpl, you need to know the order in which to call the API functions, and
the background concepts of format string, arrays and index numbers.

Order of functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating a tpl is always the first step, and freeing it is the last step. In
between, you either pack and dump the tpl (if you're serializing data) or you
load a tpl image and unpack it (if you're deserializing data).

.Order of usage 
[width="50%",cols="^1,^5m,^5m",grid="none",options="header"]
|===============================================================================

| 4.   |     tpl_free()              |      tpl_free()       
|===============================================================================

[[format]]
Format string
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When a tpl is created using `tpl_map()`, its data type is expressed as a format
string.  Each character in the format string has an associated argument of a 
specific type.  For example, this is how a format string and its arguments are
passed in to `tpl_map`:

    tpl_node *tn;
    char c;
    int i[10];
    tn = tpl_map("ci#", &c, i, 10);  /* ci# is our format string */

| A   |  array (...)                                             | none    
|================================================================================

Explicit sizes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The sizes of data types such as `long` and `double` vary by platform. This must
be kept in mind because most tpl format characters require a pointer argument to
a specific-sized type, listed above. You can use explicit-sized types such as
`int32_t` (defined in `inttypes.h`) in your program if you find this helpful.

[[trouble_with_double]]
The trouble with double
+++++++++++++++++++++++
Unfortunately there are no standard explicit-sized floating-point types-- no
`float64_t`, for example. If you plan to serialize `double` on your platform
using tpl's `f` format character, first be sure that your `double` is 64 bits.
Second, if you plan to deserialize it on a different kind of CPU, be sure that
both CPU's use the same floating-point representation such as IEEE 754.

[[arrays]]
Arrays 
~~~~~~
Arrays come in two kinds: *fixed-length* and *variable-length* arrays.
Intuitively, they can be thought of like conventional C arrays and linked lists.
In general, use fixed-length arrays if possible, and variable-length arrays
if necessary. The variable-length arrays support more complex data types, and
give or receive the elements to your program one by one.

Fixed-length vs. Variable-length arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Notation::
    Fixed-length arrays are denoted like `i#` (a simple type followed by one or
    more `#` signs), but variable-length arrays are denoted like `A(i)`. 
Element handling::
    All the elements of a fixed-length array are packed or unpacked at once. But
    the elements of a variable-length array are packed or unpacked one by one.
Array length::
    The number of elements in a fixed-length array is specified before use--
    before any data is packed. But variable-length arrays do not have a fixed
    element count. They can have any number of elements packed into them. When
    unpacking a variable-length array, they are unpacked one by one until they
    are exhausted.
Element types::
    Elements of fixed-length arrays can be the integer, byte, double, string
    types or structures. (This excludes format characters `BA`).  Fixed-length
    arrays can also be multi-dimensional like `i##`. Variable-length arrays can
    have simple or complex elements-- for example, an array of ints `A(i)`, an
    array of int/double pairs `A(if)`, or even nested arrays like `A(A(if))`. 

Before explaining all the concepts, it's illustrative to see how both kinds of
arrays are used. Let's pack the integers 0 through 9 both ways.

//|================================================================================
//|Fixed-length array packing                 | Variable-length array packing
//|#include "tpl.h"                           | #include "tpl.h"
//|int main() {                               | int main() {

//|  int x[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};         |   int x;
//|                                           |
//|  tn = tpl_map("i#", x, 10);               |   tn = tpl_map("A(i)", &x);
//|  /* pack all 10 elements at once */       |   /* pack one element at a time */
//|  tpl_pack(tn,0);                          |   for(x = 0; x < 10; x++) tpl_pack(tn,1);
//|  tpl_dump(tn, TPL_FILE, "/tmp/fixed.tpl");|   tpl_dump(tn, TPL_FILE, "/tmp/variable.tpl");
//|  tpl_free(tn);                            |   tpl_free(tn);
//|}                                          | }
//|================================================================================

[[fixed_pack]]
.Packing 0-9 as a fixed-length array
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include "tpl.h"
int main() {
    tpl_node *tn;
    int x[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};

    tn = tpl_map("i#", x, 10);
    tpl_pack(tn,0);                         /* pack all 10 elements at once */
    tpl_dump(tn, TPL_FILE, "/tmp/fixed.tpl");
    tpl_free(tn);
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the length of the fixed-length array (10) was passed as an argument to
`tpl_map()`.  The corresponding unpacking <<fixed_unpack,example>> is listed
further below. Now let's see how we would pack 0-9 as a variable-length array:

.Packing 0-9 as a variable-length array
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include "tpl.h"
int main() {
    tpl_node *tn;
    int x;

    tn = tpl_map("A(i)", &x);
    for(x = 0; x < 10; x++) tpl_pack(tn,1);  /* pack one element at a time */
    tpl_dump(tn, TPL_FILE, "/tmp/variable.tpl");
    tpl_free(tn);
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice how we called `tpl_pack` in a loop, once for each element 0-9. Again,
there is a corresponding unpacking <<var_unpack,example>> shown later in the
guide. You might also notice that this time, we passed 1 as the final argument
to tpl_pack. This is an index number designating which variable-length array
we're packing. In this case, there is only one.

[[index]]
Index numbers 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Index numbers identify a particular variable-length array in the format string.
Each `A(...)` in a format string has its own index number.  The index numbers
are assigned left-to-right starting from 1. Examples:

    A(i)        /* index number 1 */
    A(i)A(i)    /* index numbers 1 and 2 */
    A(A(i))     /* index numbers 1 and 2 (order is independent of nesting) */

Special index number 0
++++++++++++++++++++++
The special index number 0 designates all the format characters that are not
inside an `A(...)`.  Examples of what index 0 does (and does not) designate:

    S(ius)      /* index 0 designates the whole thing */
    iA(c)u      /* index 0 designates the i and the u */
    c#A(i)S(ci) /* index 0 designates the c# and the S(ci) */

An index number is passed to `tpl_pack` and `tpl_unpack` to specify which
variable-length array (or non-array, in the case of index number 0) to act upon.

Integers 
~~~~~~~~
The array examples <<fixed_pack,above>> demonstrated how integers could be
packed.  We'll show some further examples here of unpacking integers and dealing
with multi-dimensional arrays. The same program could be used to demonstrate
working with byte, 16-bit shorts, 32-bit or 64-bit signed and unsigned integers
with only a change to the data type and the format character.

[[fixed_unpack]]
.Unpacking 0-9 from a fixed-length array
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include "tpl.h"
int main() {
    tpl_node *tn;
    int x[10];

    tn = tpl_map("i#", x, 10);
    tpl_load(tn, TPL_FILE, "/tmp/fixed.tpl");
    tpl_unpack(tn,0);  /* unpack all 10 elements at once */
    tpl_free(tn);
    /* now do something with x[0]...x[9].. (not shown */
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For completeness, let's also see how to unpack a variable-length integer array.

[[var_unpack]]
.Unpacking 0-9 from a variable-length array
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include "tpl.h"
int main() {
    tpl_node *tn;
    int x;

    tn = tpl_map("A(i)", &x);
    tpl_load(tn, TPL_FILE, "/tmp/variable.tpl");
    while (tpl_unpack(tn,1) > 0) printf("%d\n",x); /* unpack one by one */
    tpl_free(tn);
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[multidim_int]]
Multi-dimensional arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A multi-dimensional matrix of integers can be packed and unpacked the same way
as any fixed-length array. 

  int xy[XDIM][YDIM];
  ...
  tn = tpl_map("i##", xy, XDIM, YDIM);
  tpl_pack(tn, 0);

This single call to `tpl_pack` packs the entire matrix.

Strings 
~~~~~~~
Tpl can serialize C strings. A different format is used for `char*` vs. `char[ ]`
as described below. Let's look at `char*` first:

.Packing a string
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #include "tpl.h"

    int main() {
        tpl_node *tn;
        char *s = "hello, world!";
        tn = tpl_map("s", &s);
        tpl_pack(tn,0);  /* copies "hello, world!" into the tpl */
        tpl_dump(tn,TPL_FILE,"string.tpl");
        tpl_free(tn);
    }
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `char*` must point to a null-terminated string or be a `NULL` pointer.

When deserializing (unpacking) a C string, space for it will be allocated
automatically, but you are responsible for freeing it (unless it is `NULL`):

.Unpacking a string
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #include "tpl.h"

    int main() {
        tpl_node *tn;
        char *s;
        tn = tpl_map("s", &s);
        tpl_load(tn,TPL_FILE,"string.tpl");
        tpl_unpack(tn,0);   /* allocates space, points s to "hello, world!" */
        printf("unpacked %s\n", s);
        free(s);            /* our responsibility to free s */
        tpl_free(tn);
    }
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

char* vs char[ ]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `s` format character is only for use with `char*` types. In the example
above, `s` is a `char*`. If it had been a `char s[14]`, we would use the format
characters `c#` to pack or unpack it, as a fixed-length character array. (This
unpacks the characters "in-place", instead of into a dynamically allocated
buffer). Also, a fixed-length buffer described by `c#` need not be
null-terminated.

Arrays of strings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can use fixed- or variable-length arrays of strings in tpl. An example of
packing a fixed-length two-dimensional array of strings is shown here.

  char *labels[2][3] = { {"one", "two", "three"},
                         {"eins", "zwei", "drei" } };
  tpl_node *tn;
  tn = tpl_map("s##", labels, 2, 3);
  tpl_pack(tn,0);
  tpl_dump(tn,TPL_FILE,filename);
  tpl_free(tn);

Later, when unpacking these strings, the programmer must remember to free them
one by one, after they are no longer needed. 

  char *olabels[2][3];
  int i,j;

  tn = tpl_map("s##", olabels, 2, 3);
  tpl_load(tn,TPL_FILE,filename);
  tpl_unpack(tn,0);
  tpl_free(tn);

  for(i=0;i<2;i++) {
    for(j=0;j<3;j++) {
      printf("%s\n", olabels[i][j]);
      free(olabels[i][j]);
    }
  }

Binary buffers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Packing an arbitrary-length binary buffer (tpl format character `B`) makes use
of the `tpl_bin` structure.  You must declare this structure and populate it
with the address and length of the binary buffer to be packed. 

.Packing a binary buffer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #include "tpl.h"
    #include <sys/time.h>

    int main() {
        tpl_node *tn;
        tpl_bin tb;

        /* we'll use a timeval as our guinea pig */
        struct timeval tv;       
        gettimeofday(&tv,NULL);  

        tn = tpl_map( "B", &tb );
        tb.sz = sizeof(struct timeval);  /* size of buffer to pack */
        tb.addr = &tv;                   /* address of buffer to pack */
        tpl_pack( tn, 0 );
        tpl_dump(tn, TPL_FILE, "bin.tpl");
        tpl_free(tn);
    }
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you unpack a binary buffer, tpl will automatically allocate it, and will
populate your `tpl_bin` structure with its address and length. You are
responsible for eventually freeing the buffer.

.Unpacking a binary buffer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #include "tpl.h"

    int main() {
        tpl_node *tn;
        tpl_bin tb;

        tn = tpl_map( "B", &tb );
        tpl_load( tn, TPL_FILE, "bin.tpl" );
        tpl_unpack( tn, 0 );
        tpl_free(tn);

        printf("binary buffer of length %d at address %p\n", tb.sz, tb.addr);
        free(tb.addr);  /* our responsibility to free it */
    }
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Structures
~~~~~~~~~~
You can use tpl to pack and unpack structures, and arrays of structures.

    struct ci {
        char c;
        int i;
    };
    struct ci s = {'a', 1};

    tn = tpl_map("S(ci)", &s);  /* pass structure address */
    tpl_pack(tn, 0);
    tpl_dump(tn, TPL_FILE, "struct.tpl");
    tpl_free(tn);

As shown, omit the individual arguments for the format characters inside the
parenthesis. The exception is for fixed-length arrays; when `S(...)` contains a
`#` character, its length argument is required: `tpl_map("S(f#i)", &s, 10);`

When using the `S(...)` format, the only characters allowed inside the
parentheses are `iujvcsfIU#$()`.

Structure arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Arrays of structures are the same as simple arrays. Fixed- or variable- length
arrays are supported.

  struct ci sa[100], one;

  tn = tpl_map("S(ci)#", sa, 100);  /* fixed-length array of 100 structures */
  tn = tpl_map("A(S(ci))", &one);   /* variable-length array (one at a time)*/

The differences between fixed- and variable-length arrays are explained in the 
<<arrays,Arrays>> section.

Nested structures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When dealing with nested structures, the outermost structure uses the `S` format
character, and the inner nested structures use the `$` format. Only the 
'outermost' structure's address is given to `tpl_map`.

  struct inner_t {
    char a;
  }

  struct outer_t {
    char b;
    struct inner_t i;
  }

  tpl_node *tn;
  struct outer_t outer = {'b', {'a'}};

  tn = tpl_map("S(c$(c))", &outer);

Structures can nest to any level. Currently tpl does not support fixed-length
array suffixes on inner structures.  However the outermost structure can have a
length suffix even if it contains some nested structures. 

Linked lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~
While tpl has no specific data type for a linked list, the technique for
packing them is illustrated here.  First describe your list element as a
format string and then surround it with `A(...)` to describe it as
variable-length array.  Then, using a temporary variable, iterate over each
list element, copying it to the temporary variable and packing it.

  struct element {
    char c;
    int i;
    struct element *next;
  }

  struct element *list, *i, tmp;
  tpl_node *tn;

  /* add some elements to list.. (not shown)*/

  tn = tpl_map("A(ci)", &tmp);
  for(i = list; i != NULL; i=i->next) {
    tmp = *i; 
    tpl_pack(tn, 1);
  }
  tpl_dump(tn,TPL_FILE,"list.tpl");
  tpl_free(tn);

Unpacking is similar. The `for` loop is just replaced with:

  while( tpl_unpack(tn,1) > 0) {
    struct element *newelt = malloc(sizeof(struct element));
    *newelt = tmp;
    add_to_list(list, newelt);
  }

As you can see, tpl does not reinstate the whole list at once-- just one
element at a time. You need to link the elements manually. A future release of
tpl may support 'pointer swizzling' to make this easier.

API

[[tpl_map]]
tpl_map
~~~~~~~
The only way to create a tpl is to call `tpl_map()`. The first argument is the
<<format,format string>>. This is followed by a list of arguments as required by
the particular characters in the format string. E.g,

    tpl_node *tn;
    int i;
    tn = tpl_map( "A(i)", &i );

The function creates a mapping between the items in the format string and the C
program variables whose addresses are given. Later, the C variables will be read
or written as the tpl is packed or unpacked.

This function returns a `tpl_node*` on success, or `NULL` on failure. 

[[tpl_pack]]
tpl_pack
~~~~~~~~
The function `tpl_pack()` packs data into a tpl. The arguments to
`tpl_pack()` are a `tpl_node*` and an <<index,index number>>.

    tn = tpl_map("A(i)A(c)", &i, &c);
    for(i=0; i<10; i++) tpl_pack(tn, 1);    /* pack 0-9 into index 1 */
    for(c='a; c<='z'; c++) tpl_pack(tn, 2); /* pack a-z into index 2 */

.Data is copied when packed
********************************************************************************
Every call to `tpl_pack()` immediately 'copies' the data being packed. Thus
the program is free to immediately overwrite or re-use the packed variables.
********************************************************************************

Index number 0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is necessary to pack index number 0 only if the format string contains
characters that are not inside an `A(...)`, such as the `i` in the format string
`iA(c)`.

Variable-length arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adding elements to an array
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To add elements to a variable-length array, call `tpl_pack()` repeatedly.  Each
call adds another element to the array. 

Zero-length arrays are ok
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
It's perfectly acceptable to pack nothing into a variable-length array,
resulting in a zero-length array.  

[[nested_pack]]
Packing nested arrays
+++++++++++++++++++++
In a format string containing a nested, variable-length array, such as
`A(A(s))`, the inner, child array should be packed prior to the parent array.

When you pack a parent array, a "snapshot" of the current child array is placed
into the parent's new element.  Packing a parent array also empties the child
array. This way, you can pack new data into the child, then pack the parent
again. This creates distinct parent elements which each contain distinct child
arrays.

[TIP]
When dealing with nested arrays like `A(A(i))`, 'pack' them from the "inside
out" (child first), but 'unpack' them from the "outside in" (parent first).

The example below creates a tpl having the format string `A(A(c))`.  

.Packing nested arrays
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include "tpl.h"

int main() {
    char c;
    tpl_node *tn;

    tn = tpl_map("A(A(c))", &c);

    for(c='a'; c<'c'; c++) tpl_pack(tn,2);  /* pack child (twice) */
    tpl_pack(tn, 1);                        /* pack parent */

    for(c='1'; c<'4'; c++) tpl_pack(tn,2);  /* pack child (three times) */
    tpl_pack(tn, 1);                        /* pack parent */

    tpl_dump(tn, TPL_FILE, "test40.tpl");
    tpl_free(tn);
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This creates a nested array in which the parent has two elements: the first
element is the two-element nested array 'a', 'b'; and the second element is
the three-element nested array '1', '2', '3'. 
The <<nested_unpack,nested unpacking example>> shows how this tpl is unpacked.

[[tpl_dump]]
tpl_dump
~~~~~~~~
After packing a tpl, `tpl_dump()` is used to write the tpl image to a file,
memory buffer or file descriptor. The corresponding modes are shown below. A
final mode is for querying the output size without actually performing the dump.

[width="80%",options="header",cols="30^d,70m",grid="none"]
|================================================================================
|Write to...      |Usage                                                  
|file             |tpl_dump(tn, TPL_FILE, "file.tpl" );                   
|file descriptor  |tpl_dump(tn, TPL_FD, 2);                               
|memory           |tpl_dump(tn, TPL_MEM, &addr, &len );                   
|caller's memory  |tpl_dump(tn, TPL_MEM\|TPL_PREALLOCD, buf, sizeof(buf));
|just get size    |tpl_dump(tn, TPL_GETSIZE, &sz);                        
|================================================================================

The first argument is the `tpl_node*` and the second is one of these constants:

`TPL_FILE`::
    Writes the tpl to a file whose name is given in the following argument.
    The file is created with permissions 664 (`rw-rw-r--`) unless further
    restricted by the process `umask`.
`TPL_FD`::
    Writes the tpl to the file descriptor given in the following argument.
    The descriptor can be either blocking or non-blocking, but will busy-loop
    if non-blocking and the contents cannot be written immediately.
`TPL_MEM`::
    Writes the tpl to a memory buffer. The following two arguments must be a
    `void\*\*` and a `size_t*`. The function will allocate a buffer and store
    its address and length into these locations.  The caller is responsible to
    `free()` the buffer when done using it. 
`TPL_MEM|TPL_PREALLOCD`::
    Writes the tpl to a memory buffer that the caller has already allocated or
    declared. The following two arguments must be a `void*` and a `size_t`
    specifying the buffer address and size respectively. (If the buffer is of
    insufficient size to receive the tpl dump, the function will return -1).
    This mode can be useful in conjunction with `tpl_load` in `TPL_EXCESS_OK`
    mode, as shown <<excess_ok,here.>>
`TPL_GETSIZE`::
    This special mode does not actually dump the tpl. Instead it places the size
    that the dump 'would' require into the `uint32_t` pointed to by the
    following argument.

The return value is 0 on success, or -1 on error. 
    
The `tpl_dump()` function does not free the tpl.  Use `tpl_free()` to release
the tpl's resources when done.

[TIP]
.Back-to-back tpl images require no delimiter
If you want to store a series of tpl images, or transmit sequential tpl images
over a socket (perhaps as messages to another program), you can simply dump them
sequentially without needing to add any delimiter for the individual tpl images.
Tpl images are internally delimited, so `tpl_load` will read just one at a time
even if multiple images are contiguous.

[[tpl_load]]
tpl_load
~~~~~~~~
This API function reads a previously-dumped tpl image from a file, memory
buffer or file descriptor, and prepares it for subsequent unpacking.  The format
string specified in the preceding call to `tpl_map()` will be cross-checked
for equality with the format string stored in the tpl image.

    tn = tpl_map( "A(i)", &i );
    tpl_load( tn, TPL_FILE, "demo.tpl" );  

The first argument to `tpl_load()` is the `tpl_node*`.  The second argument is
one of the constants:

`TPL_FILE`::
    Loads the tpl from the file named in the following argument. It is also
    possible to bitwise-OR this flag with `TPL_EXCESS_OK` as explained below.
`TPL_MEM`::
    Loads the tpl from a memory buffer. The following two arguments must be a
    `void*` and a `size_t`, specifying the buffer address and size,
    respectively.  The caller must not free the memory buffer until after
    freeing the tpl with `tpl_free()`. (If the caller wishes to hand over
    responsibility for freeing the memory buffer, so that it's automatically
    freed along with the tpl when `tpl_free()` is called, the constant
    `TPL_UFREE` may be bitwise-OR'd with `TPL_MEM` to achieve this).
    Furthermore, `TPL_MEM` may be bitwise-OR'd with `TPL_EXCESS_OK`, explained
    below.
`TPL_FD`::
    Loads the tpl from the file descriptor given in the following argument.
    The descriptor is read until one complete tpl image is loaded; no bytes
    past the end of the tpl image will be read.  The descriptor can be either
    blocking or non-blocking, but will busy-loop if non-blocking and the
    contents cannot be read immediately. 

During loading, the tpl image will be extensively checked for internal validity.

This function returns 0 on success or -1 on error. 

[[excess_ok]]
`TPL_EXCESS_OK`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When reading a tpl image from a file or memory (but not from a file descriptor)
the size of the file or memory buffer must exactly equal that of the tpl image
stored therein. In other words, no excess trailing data beyond the tpl image is
permitted. The bit flag `TPL_EXCESS_OK` can be OR'd with `TPL_MEM` or `TPL_FILE`
to relax this requirement. 

A situation where this flag can be useful is in conjunction with `tpl_dump` in
the `TPL_MEM|TPL_PREALLOCD` mode. In this example, the program does not concern
itself with the actual tpl size as long as `LEN` is sufficiently large.

  char buf[LEN];  /* will store and read tpl images here */
  ...
  tpl_dump(tn, TPL_MEM|TPL_PREALLOCD, buf, LEN);
  ...
  tpl_load(tn, TPL_MEM|TPL_EXCESS_OK, buf, LEN);




[[tpl_unpack]]
tpl_unpack
~~~~~~~~~~
The `tpl_unpack()` function unpacks data from the tpl. When data is unpacked,
it is copied to the C program variables originally specified in `tpl_map()`.
The first argument to `tpl_unpack` is the `tpl_node*` for the tpl and the
second argument is an <<index,index number>>.

    tn = tpl_map( "A(i)A(c)", &i, &c );
    tpl_load( tn, TPL_FILE, "nested.tpl" );
    while (tpl_unpack( tn, 1) > 0) printf("i is %d\n", i); /* unpack index 1 */
    while (tpl_unpack( tn, 2) > 0) printf("c is %c\n", c); /* unpack index 2 */

Index number 0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is necessary to unpack index number 0 only if the format string contains
characters that are not inside an `A(...)`, such as the `i` in the format string
`iA(c)`.

Variable-length arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unpacking elements from an array
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
For variable-length arrays, each call to `tpl_unpack()` unpacks another element.
The return value can be used to tell when you're done: if it's positive, an
element was unpacked; if it's 0, nothing was unpacked because there are no more
elements. A negative retun value indicates an error (e.g. invalid index number).
In this document, we usually unpack variable-length arrays using a `while` loop:

    while( tpl_unpack( tn, 1 ) > 0 ) {
        /* got another element */
    }

Array length
++++++++++++
When unpacking a variable-length array, it may be convenient to know ahead of
time how many elements will need to be unpacked.  You can use `tpl_Alen()` to
get this number.

[[nested_unpack]]
Unpacking nested arrays
+++++++++++++++++++++++
In a format string containing a nested variable-length array such as `A(A(s))`,
unpack the outer, parent array before unpacking the child array. 

When you unpack a parent array, it prepares the child array for unpacking.
After unpacking the elements of the child array, the program can repeat the
process by unpacking another parent element, then the child elements, and so on.
The example below unpacks a tpl having the format string `A(A(c))`.  

.Unpacking nested arrays
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include "tpl.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char c;
    tpl_node *tn;

    tn = tpl_map("A(A(c))", &c);

    tpl_load(tn, TPL_FILE, "test40.tpl");
    while (tpl_unpack(tn,1) > 0) {
        while (tpl_unpack(tn,2) > 0) printf("%c ",c);
        printf("\n");
    }
    tpl_free(tn);
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file `test40.tpl` is from the <<nested_pack,nested packing example>>. When
run, this program prints:

    a b 
    1 2 3 

[[tpl_free]]
tpl_free
~~~~~~~~
The final step for any tpl is to release it using `tpl_free()`. Its only
argument is the the `tpl_node*` to free.
    
    tpl_free( tn );

This function does not return a value (it is `void`).

[[tpl_alen]]
tpl_Alen
~~~~~~~~
This function takes a `tpl_node*` and an index number and returns an `int`
specifying the number of elements in the variable-length array.

    num_elements = tpl_Alen(tn, index);

This is mainly useful for programs that unpack data and need to know ahead of
time the number of elements that will need to be unpacked. (It returns the
current number of elements; it will decrease as elements are unpacked).

[[tpl_peek]]
tpl_peek
~~~~~~~~
This function peeks into a file or a memory buffer containing a tpl image and
and returns a copy of its format string.  It can also peek at the lengths of
any fixed-length arrays in the format string, or it can also peek into the data
stored in the tpl.  

Format peek
^^^^^^^^^^^
The format string can be obtained
like this:

    fmt = tpl_peek(TPL_FILE, "file.tpl");   
    fmt = tpl_peek(TPL_MEM, addr, sz); 

On success, a copy of the format string is returned. The caller must eventually
free it. On error, such as a non-existent file, or an invalid tpl image, it
returns `NULL`.

Array length peek
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The lengths of all fixed-length arrays in the format string can be queried using
the `TPL_FXLENS` mode. It provides the number of such fixed-length arrays and
their lengths. If the former is non-zero, the caller must free the latter array
when finished. The format string itself must also be freed.

    uint32_t num_fxlens, *fxlens, j;
    fmt = tpl_peek(TPL_FILE|TPL_FXLENS, filename, &num_fxlens, &fxlens);
    if (fmt) {
      printf("format %s, num_fxlens %u\n", fmt, num_fxlens);
      for(j=0; j<num_fxlens; j++) printf("fxlens[%u] %u\n", j, fxlens[j]);
      if (num_fxlens > 0) free(fxlens);
      free(fmt);
    }

The `TPL_FXLENS` mode is mutually exclusive with `TPL_DATAPEEK`.


Data peek
^^^^^^^^^
To peek into the data, additional arguments are used. This is a quick
alternative to mapping, loading and unpacking the tpl, but peeking is limited
to the data in index 0. In other words, no peeking into `A(...)` types.
Suppose the tpl image in `file.tpl` has the format string `siA(i)`. Then the
index 0 format characters are `si`. This is how to peek at their content:

  char *s;
  int i;
  fmt = tpl_peek(TPL_FILE | TPL_DATAPEEK, "file.tpl", "si", &s, &i);

Now `s`, `i`, and `fmt` have been populated with data.  The caller must
eventually free `fmt` and `s` because they are allocated strings.
Of course, it works with `TPL_MEM` as well as `TPL_FILE`.  Notice that
`TPL_DATAPEEK` was OR'd with the mode. You can also specify 'any leading
portion' of the index 0 format if you don't want to peek at the whole thing: 

  fmt = tpl_peek(TPL_FILE | TPL_DATAPEEK, "file.tpl", "s", &s);

The `TPL_DATAPEEK` mode is mutually exclusive with `TPL_FXLENS`.

Structure peek
++++++++++++++
Lastly you can peek into `S(...)` structures in index 0, but omit the
surrounding `S(...)` in the format, and specify an argument to receive
each structure member individually. You can specify any leading portion
of the structure format. For example if `struct.tpl` has the format string
`S(si)`, you can peek at its data in these ways:

  fmt = tpl_peek(TPL_FILE | TPL_DATAPEEK, "struct.tpl", "s", &s);
  fmt = tpl_peek(TPL_FILE | TPL_DATAPEEK, "struct.tpl", "si", &s, &i);

[[tpl_jot]]
tpl_jot
~~~~~~~
This is a quick shortcut for generating a tpl. It can be used instead of the
usual "map, pack, dump, and free" lifecycle. With `tpl_jot` all those steps are
handled for you.  It only works for simple formats-- namely, those without
`A(...)` in their format string. Here is how it is used:

  char *hello = "hello", *world = "world";
  tpl_jot( TPL_FILE, "file.tpl", "ss", &hello, &world);

It supports the three standard modes, `TPL_FILE`, `TPL_FD` and `TPL_MEM`.
It returns -1 on failure (such as a bad format string or error writing the
file) or 0 on success.

[[hooks]]
tpl_hook
~~~~~~~~
Most users will just leave these hooks at their default values. You can change
these hook values if you want to modify tpl's internal memory management and
error reporting behavior.

A global structure called `tpl_hook` encapsulates the hooks.  A program can
reconfigure any hook by specifying an alternative function whose prototype
matches the default. For example:

    #include "tpl.h"
    extern tpl_hook_t tpl_hook;

    int main() {
        tpl_hook.oops = printf;
        ...
    }

.Configurable hooks
[width="90%",options="header",cols="m,d,m",grid="none"]
|================================================================================
|Hook                |Description                  | Default
|tpl_hook.oops       |log error messages           | tpl_oops 
|tpl_hook.malloc     |allocate memory              | malloc
|tpl_hook.realloc    |reallocate memory            | realloc
|tpl_hook.free       |free memory                  | free
|tpl_hook.fatal      |log fatal message and exit   | tpl_fatal
|tpl_hook.gather_max |tpl_gather max image size    | 0 (unlimited)
|================================================================================

The oops hook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `oops` has the same prototype as `printf`. The built-in default oops
handling function writes the error message to `stderr`.

The fatal hook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The fatal hook is invoked when a tpl function cannot continue because of an out-
of-memory condition or some other usage violation or inconsistency. It has this
prototype:

  void fatal_fcn(char *fmt, ...);

The `fatal` hook must not return. It must either exit, 'or' if the program needs
to handle the failure and keep executing, `setjmp` and `longjmp` can be used.
The default behavior is to `exit(-1)`.

.Using longjmp in a fatal error handler
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <setjmp.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include "tpl.h"

jmp_buf env;
extern tpl_hook_t tpl_hook;

void catch_fatal(char *fmt, ...) {
  va_list ap;

  va_start(ap, fmt);
  vfprintf(stderr, fmt, ap);
  va_end(ap);
  longjmp(env,-1);                /* return to setjmp point */
}

int main() {
  int err;
  tpl_node *tn;
  tpl_hook.fatal = catch_fatal;    /* install fatal handler */

  err = setjmp(env); /* on error, control will return here  */
  if (err) {
    printf("caught error!\n");
    return -1;
  }

  tn = tpl_map("@");              /* generate a fatal error */
  printf("program ending, without error\n");
  return 0;
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This example is included in `tests/test123.c`. When run, this program prints:

  unsupported option @
  failed to parse @
  caught error!


tpl_gather
~~~~~~~~~~

.Most programs don't need this
********************************************************************************
Normally, `tpl_load()` is used to read a tpl image having an expected format
string.  A more generic operation is to acquire a tpl image whose format string is
unknown. E.g., a generic message-receiving function might gather tpl images of
varying format and route them to their final destination. This is the purpose of
`tpl_gather`. It produces a memory buffer containing one tpl image. If there
are multiple contiguous images in the input, it gathers exactly one image at a 
time.
********************************************************************************

The prototype for this function is:

    int tpl_gather( int mode, ...);

The `mode` argument is one of three constants listed below, which must be
followed by the mode-specific required arguments: 

    TPL_GATHER_BLOCKING,    int fd, void **img, size_t *sz
    TPL_GATHER_NONBLOCKING, int fd, tpl_gather_t **gs, tpl_gather_cb *cb, void *data
    TPL_GATHER_MEM,         void *addr, size_t sz, tpl_gather_t **gs, tpl_gather_cb *cb, void *data

[NOTE]
.`tpl_hook.gather_max` 
All modes honor `tpl_hook.gather_max`, specifying the maximum byte size for a
tpl image to be gathered (the default is unlimited, signified by 0). If a source
attempts to send a tpl image larger than this maximum, whatever partial image
has been read will be discarded, and no further reading will take place; in this
case `tpl_gather` will return a negative (error) value to inform the caller that
it should stop gathering from this source, and close the originating file
descriptor if there is one. (The whole idea is to prevent untrusted sources from
sending extremely large tpl images which would consume too much memory.)


`TPL_GATHER_BLOCKING`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this mode, `tpl_gather` blocks while reading file descriptor `fd` until one
complete tpl image is read. No bytes past the end of the tpl image will be read.
The address of the buffer containing the image is returned in `img` and its size
is placed in `sz`. The caller is responsible for eventually freeing the buffer.
The function returns 1 on success, 0 on end-of-file, or a negative number on
error.

`TPL_GATHER_NONBLOCKING`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This mode is for non-blocking, event-driven programs that implement their
own file descriptor readability testing using `select()` or the like. In this
mode, tpl images are gathered in chunks as data becomes readable. Whenever a
full tpl image has been gathered, it invokes a caller-specified callback to do
something with the image.  The arguments are the file descriptor `fd` which the
caller has determined to be readable and which must be in non-blocking mode, a
pointer to a file-descriptor-specific handle which the caller has declared
(explained below); a callback to invoke when a tpl image has been read; and an
opaque pointer that will passed to the callback.

For each file descriptor on which `tpl_gather` will be used, the caller must
declare a `tpl_gather_t*` and initialize it to `NULL`. Thereafter it will be
used internally by `tpl_gather` whenever data is readable on the descriptor.

The callback will only be invoked whenever `tpl_gather()` has accumulated one
complete tpl image. It must have this prototype:

    int (tpl_gather_cb)(void *img, size_t sz, void *data);

The callback can do anything with the tpl image but it must not free it. It can
be copied if it needs to survive past the callback's return. The callback should
return 0 under normal circumstances, or a negative number to abort; that is,
returning a negative number causes `tpl_gather` itself to discard any remaining
full or partial tpl images that have been read, and to return a negative number
(-4 in particular) to signal its caller to close the file descriptor.

The return value of `tpl_gather()` is negative if an error occured or 0 if a
normal EOF was encountered-- both cases require that the caller close the file
descriptor (and stop monitoring it for readability, obviously). If the return
value is positive, the function succeeded in gathering whatever data was
currently readable, which may have been a partial tpl image, or one or more
complete images.

Typical Usage
+++++++++++++
The program will have established a file descriptor in non-blocking mode and
be monitoring it for readability, using `select()`. Whenever it's readable, the
program calls `tpl_gather()`. In skeletal terms:

    tpl_gather_t *gt=NULL;
    int rc;

    void fd_is_readable(int fd) {
      rc = tpl_gather( TPL_GATHER_NONBLOCKING, fd, &gt, callback, NULL );
      if (rc <= 0) {
          close(fd);               /* got eof or fatal */
          stop_watching_fd(fd);
      }
    }

    int callback( void *img, size_t sz, void *data ) {
      printf("got a tpl image\n"); /* do something with img. do not free it. */
      return 0;                    /* normal (no error) */
    }

`TPL_GATHER_MEM`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This mode is identical to `TPL_GATHER_NONBLOCKING` except that it gathers from a
memory buffer instead of from a file descriptor. In other words, if some other
layer of code-- say, a decryption function (that is decrypting fixed-size
blocks) produces tpl fragments one-by-one, this mode can be used to reconstitute
the tpl images and invoke the callback for each one. Its parameters are the same
as for the `TPL_GATHER_NONBLOCKING` mode except that instead of a file
