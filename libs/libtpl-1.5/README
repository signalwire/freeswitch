tpl: fast, easy serialization in C
==============================================================================

Documentation for tpl is available in the doc/ directory or at:

    http://tpl.sourceforge.net

You can build tpl as a library, like so:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

This installs libtpl.so and libtpl.a into a standard system library directory.
You can customize the install directory using configure's "--prefix" option:

    ./configure --prefix=/some/directory

For other options accepted by configure, run "./configure --help".

NON-LIBRARY OPTION
------------------
Alternatively, if you don't want to muck around with libraries, you can simply        
copy these two files into your own C project and build them with your program:

    src/tpl.h
    src/tpl.c

WINDOWS
-------
You can build tpl as a DLL under Visual Studio 2008. Or you can use MinGW or
Cygwin.

SELF-TEST SUITE
---------------
The automated self-test can be run by doing:

    cd tests
    make

LICENSE
-------
The BSD license applies to this software. The text is in the LICENSE file.

CREDITS
-------
Many people have contributed to tpl, both bits of code and ideas. Rather than
listing them all here, at risk of omitting anyone- I just wish to say thank
you. Some particular features are noted with contributors' names in the
ChangeLog. 

Feel free to send me questions, comments or bug reports.
