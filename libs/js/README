  OSSP js - Mozilla JavaScript Engine
  Version 1.6.20060820 (20-Aug-2006)

  ABSTRACT

  OSSP js is a stand-alone distribution of the JavaScript (JS)
  programming language reference implementation from Mozilla -- aka
  "JSRef" or "SpiderMonkey". This distribution provides a smart,
  stand-alone and portable distribution of Mozilla JavaScript through a
  build environment based on GNU autoconf, GNU libtool and GNU shtool,
  including support for easy JavaScript build-time feature set selection
  (ECMA-3, JS-1.5, JS-1.6), optional CLI line editing support, optional
  "stdio" based File object support and JS/Perl bindings. Additionally,
  the C API in "libjs" contains both the JavaScript engine and the
  required Sun math library ("fdlibm") and with all internal symbols
  carefully protected under the "js" namespace. Finally, a js-config(1)
  utility and a pkg-config(1) specification is provided to allow
  applications to easily build with the JavaScript C API.

  JUSTIFICATION

  OSSP js was created because for OSSP and similar pedantic C coding
  projects a smart, stand-alone, portable, clean, powerful and
  robust scripting language engine is required. JavaScript is a
  great programming language and Mozilla JavaScript "SpiderMonkey"
  definitely is an acceptable clean, powerful and robust implementation.
  Unfortunately there is just a stand-alone distribution released from
  time to time by Mozilla and it is far away from really being smart,
  stand-alone and portable. At least for OSSP it was not acceptable
  having to tell the community that for small and stand-alone C
  components like the OSSP components they either have to install the
  great but large Mozilla Firefox application (where Mozilla JavaScript
  is included) or have to fiddle around theirself with an older
  stand-alone JavaScript distribution and its weak build environment.
  OSSP js combines the best from two worlds: the 1:1 repackaged
  JavaScript code base from Mozilla and the usual amount of GNU
  autoconf, GNU libtool and GNU shtool wrappers as always used by OSSP.
  Additionally, stand-alone ("stdio" instead of NSPR based) File object
  support was required.

  VERSIONING

  The version of OSSP js is M.N.YYYYMMDD where M.N is the JavaScript
  branch and YYYYMMDD is the date where the JavaScript code was
  extracted from the Mozilla CVS repository.
