Use the following scripts to verify the decoder implementation:

o test_encoder.bat / test_encoder.sh

  Make sure the encoder executable to be tested exists in the parent directory, and run 
  test_encoder.bat (win) or test_encoder.sh (linux/mac). This will run the encoder 
  and compare the output bitstream with the reference bitstream files. The result is 
  written to test_encoder_report.txt.
  For each file, the bitstreams are either bit-exact or they differ. The compatibility 
  test is passed if each file is reported as "PASS".

o test_decoder.bat / test_decoder.sh

  Make sure the decoder executable to be tested exists in the parent directory, and run 
  test_decoder.bat (win) or test_decoder.sh (linux/mac). This will run the decoder 
  and compare the output audio file with the reference audio files. The result is 
  written to test_decoder_report.txt.
  For each file, the bitstreams are either bit-exact or they match up to a certain
  average weighted SNR. The compatibility test is passed if each file is reported as 
  "PASS".


NOTE: When using the shell script, make sure it is marked as executable.
      This can be done by: chmod +x *.sh
