/*
Functions that create and destroy objects always take pointer to pointer of that type.
Spaces after loop and conditional operators while, for, if etc.
Newlines after one or more declarations.
Newlines before and after loops.
Newlines before returns.
One-Line if/else sparingly only when very obvious exit from loop or return.
Use brackets even when not necessary other than the one-liners above.
Align the * in pointers to the type or function name (e.g char *foo, char *some_func(char *data) )
Use typedefs for structs especially public-facing.
Only use // style-comments on tempory comments that will probably be removed eventually.
Add the emacs/vi comment to the bottom of every file.
Use Doxygen for function args.
Tabs not spaces.
Use flags as bitwise when possible, use arrays if going beyond 32
Typedef all enums using UPPER_CASE notation for the values
