==============================================
Release notes for current version of Sofia-SIP
==============================================

Changes since last release
--------------------------

Beside bugfixes, a server graylisting was added to nta and a few
improvements in event handling were made in nua interface.

A check-based test program was added, too.

API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

New features in API are marked with Doxytag macro @NEW_1_12_8 or
@VERSION_1_12_8.

libsofia-sip-ua:
- Added nta_sip_is_internal(), nta_msg_is_internal() function in
  <sofia-sip/nta.h>. Deprecating nta_is_internal_msg().
- Added su_msg_new(), su_msg_send_to() and su_msg_deinitializer() for more 
  robust and light-weight message passing in <sofia-sip/su_wait.h>
- Added su_home_lock(), su_home_trylock(), and su_home_unlock() in
  <sofia-sip/su_alloc.h>
- Added type-neutral template macros for hash tables HTABLE2_DECLARE2(), HTABLE2_PROTOS2(),
  and HTABLE2_BODIES2().
- Added sres_cache_set_srv_priority() in <sofia-resolv/sres_cache.h> and 
  sres_set_cached_srv_priority() <sofia-resolv/sres.h> for graylisting
  SRV records for inresponsive servers.
- nua_create()/nta_agent_create()/tport_bind() now joins to multicast group
  if "maddr" parameter is specified
- This release is ABI/API compatible with applications linked against 
  any 1.12.x release. However, applications built against this release won't 
  work against an older library. The ABI has been tested with the nua module 
  unit test (test_nua) built against original 1.12.0 release.

libsofia-sip-ua-glib:
- No ABI/API changes, compatible with 1.12.0. Note, libsofia-sip-ua-glib
  interface is not considered stable and may change in a future 1.12.x
  release.

Contributors to this release
----------------------------

- Bernhard Suttner contributed patch to soa for using a=inactive attribute
  with call hold
- Stefan Leuenberger from Netmodule contributed the hack for changing
  priority of SRV records if a SIP server was inresponsive
- Daniele Rondina contributed patches fixing crash in STUN discovery cleanup
  and for transport handling with nta_outgoing_*create()
- Youness Alaoui sent a iPhone build fix
- Michael Jerris and Stefan Knoblich from Freeswitch project reported
  numerous bugs and contributed fixes

Notes on new features
---------------------

SIP Server Graylisting
----------------------

The hack contributed by Stefan Leuenberger from Netmodule changes the
priority of SRV records which are used when SIP URI is resolved.

If your domain has multiple servers, you can define separate SRV records for
them. If any of them becomes unresponsive, a SIP request sent to it times
out or gets rejected because of network error and Sofia SIP automatically
retries with another server. However, as Sofia SIP does not keep track of
failed servers with the next request it may again try first the failed
server. The graylisting repriotizes the SRV records so that the priority of
the failed server gets reduced and it won't be tried again until all other
servers have failed, too. Note that the SIP URI resolver may get confused
when using this kind of repriotizing if a single SRV record corresponds to
multiple servers or servers with multiple addresses.

You can disable the reprioritizing hack by including tag NTATAG_GREYLIST(0)
with nua_create(), nua_set_params(), nta_agent_create() or
nta_agent_set_params().
