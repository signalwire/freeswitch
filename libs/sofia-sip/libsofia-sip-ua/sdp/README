SDP Parser and Printer
======================

	This directory contains SDP parser and printer code.  Parser takes an
	message and returns a corresponding C structure. Printer takes a C
	structure and returns a SDP message.

	There is an incomplete documentation in sdp.html on usage of
	parser and printer.

	Please refer to RFC 2327 for further information.
