UniMRCP Client (UMC) Scenarios
==============================

This folder contains scenario files loaded by the sample client application umc.

There are a number of scenarios to use. Each scenario is given an arbitrary but unique name and is
associated to one of the predefined classes as follows:

	<umcscenario name="synth" class="Synthesizer">
	<umcscenario name="recog" class="Recognizer">
	<umcscenario name="rec" class="Recorder">
	<umcscenario name="verify" class="Verifier">
	<umcscenario name="dtmf" class="DtmfRecognizer">
	<umcscenario name="params" class="Params">

More than one scenario of the same type (class) can be defined and loaded. The name but not the
class of the scenario is used to run it from the umc console.

For example:

	> run synth
or
	> run recog
