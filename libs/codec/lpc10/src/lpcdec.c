Revision 1.1  2000/06/05 04:45:12  robertj
Added LPC-10 2400bps codec

 * Revision 1.2  1996/08/20  20:30:11  jaf
 * Removed all static local variables that were SAVE'd in the Fortran
 * code, and put them in struct lpc10_encoder_state that is passed as an
 * argument.
 *
 * Removed init function, since all initialization is now done in
 * init_lpc10_encoder_state().
 *
 * Changed name of function from lpcenc_ to lpc10_encode, simply to make
 * all lpc10 functions have more consistent naming with each other.

/*   LPC Processing control variables: */

/* *** Read-only: initialized in setup */

/*  Files for Speech, Parameter, and Bitstream Input & Output, */
/*    and message and debug outputs. */

/* Here are the only files which use these variables: */

/* lpcsim.f setup.f trans.f error.f vqsetup.f */

/* Many files which use fdebug are not listed, since it is only used in */
/* those other files conditionally, to print trace statements. */
/* 	integer fsi, fso, fpi, fpo, fbi, fbo, pbin, fmsg, fdebug */
/*  LPC order, Frame size, Quantization rate, Bits per frame, */
/*    Error correction */
/* Subroutine SETUP is the only place where order is assigned a value, */
/* and that value is 10.  It could increase efficiency 1% or so to */
/* declare order as a constant (i.e., a Fortran PARAMETER) instead of as 
*/
/* a variable in a COMMON block, since it is used in many places in the */
/* core of the coding and decoding routines.  Actually, I take that back. 
*/
/* At least when compiling with f2c, the upper bound of DO loops is */
/* stored in a local variable before the DO loop begins, and then that is 
*/
/* compared against on each iteration. */
/* Similarly for lframe, which is given a value of MAXFRM in SETUP. */
/* Similarly for quant, which is given a value of 2400 in SETUP.  quant */
/* is used in only a few places, and never in the core coding and */
/* decoding routines, so it could be eliminated entirely. */
/* nbits is similar to quant, and is given a value of 54 in SETUP. */
/* corrp is given a value of .TRUE. in SETUP, and is only used in the */
/* subroutines ENCODE and DECODE.  It doesn't affect the speed of the */
/* coder significantly whether it is .TRUE. or .FALSE., or whether it is 
*/
/* a constant or a variable, since it is only examined once per frame. */
/* Leaving it as a variable that is set to .TRUE.  seems like a good */
/* idea, since it does enable some error-correction capability for */
/* unvoiced frames, with no change in the coding rate, and no noticeable 
*/
/* quality difference in the decoded speech. */

/* *** Read/write: variables for debugging, not needed for LPC algorithm 
*/

/*  Current frame, Unstable frames, Output clip count, Max onset buffer,

/* ERROR, which is only called from RCCHK.  When LPC10 is embedded into */
/* an application, I would recommend removing the call to ERROR in RCCHK,

/* and remove ERROR and nunsfm completely. */
/* iclip is initialized to 0 in SETUP, and incremented in entry SWRITE in 
*/
/* sread.f.  When LPC10 is embedded into an application, one might want */
/* to cause it to be incremented in a routine that takes the output of */
/* SYNTHS and sends it to an audio device.  It could be optionally */
/* displayed, for those that might want to know what it is. */
/* maxosp is never initialized to 0 in SETUP, although it probably should 
*/
/* be, and it is updated in subroutine ANALYS.  I doubt that its value */
