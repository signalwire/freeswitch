FreeSWITCH for Debian
--------------

You may be reading this because you're wondering where all the files
are in debian/, such as control.

Because FreeSWITCH has so many modules it was necessary to create a
system to autogenerate the majority of the packaging.  This in done
mostly in the file debian/bootstrap.sh.  This bootstrap needs to run
before any other step of the packaging, though we do try to
autogenerate it when possible.

The build dependencies, runtime dependencies, and other details about
modules can be configured in the debian/control-modules file.  Even
though this file looks a bit like a debian control file and has a
similar format, we are parsing this file ourselves so the format is a
bit more restricted.

debian/control-modules currently supports the following fields:

  # lines that begin with the hash character are comments
  #
  # every block must start with a Module field
  Module: <category>/<module_name>
  Description: <short description>
   <long description> # empty lines with "."s are not yet supported
  Build-Depends: <build deps for this module>
  Depends: <runtime deps for this module>
  Recommends: <recommended packages>
  Suggests: <suggested packages>
  Distro-Conflicts: <distributions on which this module should not be built> # not yet implemented

During bootstrap we build a file control-modules.gen.  If the
control-modules file is properly formatted, this generated file should
be identical.  This is a sanity check mechanism for our parsing, as
well as a way to automatically reorganize the file.

If the file debian/modules.conf is present, we read that file and only
build and package the files listed there.  Otherwise, we build every
module except the ones that either should not be packaged, or for
which we don't yet have good packaging.

The format of debian/modules.conf is:

  ## comments should start with two hash characters
  <category>/<module_name>

To build this package, I recommend running the following from the root
directory of your FS git working tree:

  distro=sid
  ver="$(cat build/next-release.txt | sed -e 's/-/~/g')~n$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)-1~${distro}+1"
  git clean -fdx && git reset --hard HEAD
  ./build/set-fs-version.sh "$ver"
  git add configure.in && git commit -m "bump to custom v$ver"
  (cd debian && ./bootstrap.sh -c $distro)
  dch -b -m -v "$ver" --force-distribution -D "$suite" "Custom build."
  git-buildpackage -b -us -uc \
    --git-verbose \
    --git-pbuilder --git-dist=$distro \
    --git-compression-level=1v --git-compression=xz
  git reset --hard HEAD^
