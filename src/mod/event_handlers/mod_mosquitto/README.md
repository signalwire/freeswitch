## mod_mosquitto

mod_mosquitto is an interface to an MQTT broker using the Eclipse Mosquitto project C client library.  MQTT is a lightweight protocol to send or receive messages using a publish / subscribe pattern.  Echipse Mosquitto is an open source message broker that implements the MQTT protocol.

mod_mosquitto it able to publish and/or subscribe to one or more MQTT message brokers.
Implements a Publish/Subscribe (pub/sub) messaging pattern using the Mosquitto API library

* Multiple Subscribers
* Multiple Publishers
* Multiple Topics

## How to build and install

1.  Enable mod_mosquitto in the modules.conf file
2.  Execute configure;make;make install
3.  Restart FreeSWITCH

Note that mod_mosquitto requires libmosquitto-dev to build on Debian.

To install local modifications to mod_mosquitto:

1.  cd freeswitch/src/mod/event_handlers/mod_mosquitto
2.  Make any local modifications
3.  Execute make;make install
4.  Enter the FreeSWITCH console (fs_cli)
5.  Enter 'reload mod_mosquitto'

## Configuration

All configuration is done within the mosquitto.conf.xml file located in the freeswitch/conf/autoload_configs/mosquitto.conf.xml file.

The configuration follows the standard way all other FreeSWITCH modules are configured.

At a high level, the configuration file is organized as follows:

1.  Global / default settings are specified at the top level.
2.  One or more profiles can be defined.
3.  Within each profile, there can be one or more connections, publishers and subscribers defined.
4.  Within each publisher or subscriber, there can be one or more topics defined.
5.  Publisher topics can have one or more event parameters

## Usage

BGAPI

1.  Set up mod_mosquitto to publish the BACKGROUND_JOB event to a topic, for example: "FreeSWITCH/BACKGROUND_JOB".
2.  With your mqtt client subscribe to the above topic.
3.  Set up mod_mosquitto to subscribe to a topic with the "bgapi_authorized" permissions set, for example: "FreeSWITCH/command".
4.  With your MQTT client, publish to a topic mod_mosquitto is listening to, for example: "FreeSWITCH/command".
  The content of the published message should start with "bgapi", for example:
    bgapi version
    bgapi show registrations
5.  The responses will be published to the above topic, for example "FreeSWITCH/BACKGROUND_JOB".

ORIGINATE

1.  With your MQTT client, publish to a topic mod_mosquitto is listening to, for example: "FreeSWITCH/command".
2.  Set up mod_mosquitto to subscribe to a topic with the "originate_authorized" permissions set, for example: "FreeSWITCH/command".
3.  With your MQTT client, publish to a topic mod_mosquitto is listening to, for example: "FreeSWITCH/command".
  The content of the published message should start with "originate", for example:
    originate {origination_caller_id_number=19005551212}sofia/internal/sip:1000@192.168.1.1:58289 9386 XML default
    originate {origination_caller_id_number=9005551212}sofia/default/whatever@wherever 19005551212 XML default
4.  Note: Depending on the FreeSWITCH events being published, the result of the originate" command may, or may not be sent to the MQTT client.

SUBSCRIBE to a topic

Example of the the topic configuration to subscribe to a topic (and allowing both bgapi and originate commands):

Notes:
  1.  The topic name must be unique within a profile.
  2.  The topic can be enabled  or disabled by setting the "enable" param.
  3.  The connection_name must reference a connection previously defined in the configuration file.
  4.  The pattern must comply with MQTT standards.
  5.  The qos value must comply with MQTT standards. Value 0, 1 or 2 indicating the Quality of Service to be used.
  6.  The originate_authorized / bgapi_authorized permission flags.
    WARNING: Allowing either of these settings WILL allow phone calls to be initiated by the MQTT broker to FreeSWITCH.
    WARNING: If the connected MQTT broker is not locked down, toll fraud WILL HAPPEN by bad actors.
    WARNING: REPEATED: If the connected MQTT broker is not locked down, toll fraud WILL HAPPEN by bad actors.

PUBLISH an event to a topic:

Notes:
  1.  The topic name must be unique within a profile.
  2.  The topic can be enabled or disabled by setting the "enable" param.
  3.  The connection_name must reference a connection previously defined in the configuration file.
  4.  The pattern must comply with MQTT standards.
  5.  The qos value must comply with MQTT standards. Value 0, 1 or 2 indicating the Quality of Service to be used.
  6.  The retain boolean must be either true or false.
  7.  The event parameter must contain a single FreeSWITCH supported event.
    Multiple event parameters be be added to a topic.

The example below shows mod_mosquitto publish the single event type, HEARTBEAT to a topic called Heartbeat.
In addition, mod_mosquitto will publish two event types, HEARTBEAT and RE_SCHEDULE to a topic called Miltiple.

The list of valid FreeSWITCH event types can be found here:  https://docs.freeswitch.org/switch__types_8h.html#ac9614049b0344bb672df9d23a7ec4a09
If the above link doesn't work, search the FreeSWITCH documentaton for "switch_event_types_t".
The event names used here are the same as those defined in "switch_event_types_t" with the removal of the "SWITCH_EVENT" prefix.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The following mod_mosquitto commands can be entered in the FreeSWITCH console (fs_api):

```
mosquitto [help]
mosquitto status
mosquitto loglevel [debug|info|notice|warning|error|critical|alert|console]
mosquitto enable profile <profile-name> [connection|publisher|subscriber] <name>
mosquitto disable profile <profile-name> [connection|publisher|subscriber] <name>
mosquitto remove profile <profile-name> [connection|publisher|subscriber] <name>
mosquitto connect profile <profile-name> connection <name>
mosquitto disconnect profile <profile-name> connection <name>
mosquitto bgapi <command> [<arg>]
```

## Notes

The file EVENT_TYPES is a list of the FreeSWITCH events that can be published.  This list is accurate at the time mod_mosquitto was created.

The list of available bgapi commands are available by entering "show api" in the FreeSWITCH console (fs_cli).

Possible TODO items:

* MQTT V5 support
* Throttle (circuit-breaker) support
* Enhanced security around command execution
* Enhanced CLI functionality
* Enhanced logging / statistics
