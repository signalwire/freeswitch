MP3 library
-----------
Version 0.2

This decoder is a 'light' version (thrown out all unnecessay parts)
from the mpg123 package. I made this for a company.

Currently only Layer3 is enabled to save some space. Layer1,2 isn't
tested at all. The interface will not change significantly. 
A backport to the mpg123 package is planed.

comiled and tested only on Solaris 2.6
main.c contains a simple demo application for library.

  I also want to have the freedom to sell the code to companies that

  I need your explicit permission to do this. Of course, there will also 
  be the GPLed open source version of the 100% same code.

  I'm interessted to here from you, when you use this package as part
  of another project.
