<!--
Defines if the channel should ignore some uncommon DTMF digits detected by
the board (A, B, C and D). This reduces the number of false positives which
may happen sometimes, without affecting correctness on traditional
scenarios. However, if you need to pass those digits througth the board,
you may need to set this option to 'no'.
(default = yes)

<param name="ignore-letter-dtmfs" value="yes"/>

<!--
When there is a request to indicate busy for an incoming KFXO call, the 
ringing channel is taken off hook and then placed on hook, so it now goes
to answered state and we can send audio throught the line.

If the off/on hook time interval is too short, the PSTN may ignore it, and 
keep the line in a ringing state. If it is too long, the call may be charged.
The option below defines the delay between the line being answered and being
disconnected, in miliseconds (from 50ms to 90000ms).

(default = 1250)

(default = no)

<param name="drop-collect-call" value="no"/>
-->

<!--
Defines if the activation and deactivation of Kommuter is done automatically by the channel,
or manually by the user. Possible values:

auto     - Khomp channel driver starts all kommuter devices at initialization and stops them if the module is unloaded.
manual   - The user must explicity call the CLI command < khomp kommuter on/off >, that starts or stops the kommuter devices connected to this machine.
(default = auto)

<param name="kommuter-activation" value="auto"/>
-->

<!--
Defines the default value for the Kommuter watchdog in seconds.
All kommuters conected to this machine will be initialized with this value,
and will commute the links after reaching this time with no response of the channel.
The minimum is 0 (will never commute the links), and maximum value is 255 seconds.
(default = 10)

<param name="kommuter-timeout" value="10"/>

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; CONTEXTS WILDCARDS ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For incoming contexts, you can use the following wildcards:

'DD' (device number): the sequence number of the board on the
system (can be checked using "khomp summary", valid for all
board models);

'LL' (link number): the sequence number of link where the call
has arrived on the board. valid only for E1 boards.

'SSSS' (serial number): the serial number of the board (can
be checked using "khomp summary", and it's valid for all
board models);

'CC' (channel number): the channel number on which the call
or message has arrived (valid for FXO, FXS and GSM boards);

'CCC' (channel number): same as above, but valid only for E1
channels;
-->

<!--  Section for configuring allocation groups. -->
<groups>
<!--
In this section, you should define options using the following syntax:

<groupname> = <allocation-string>[:<context>]

<param name="pstn" value="b0l0 + b1c38"/>
<param name="pstn" value="b0l0 + b1c38:from-pstn"/>

You may define your own groups. In the example above, the group 
called pstn can be used in the bridge string as <action application="brigde" data="Khomp/Gpstn/..." />
or <action application="brigde" data="Khomp/Gpstn/..." />. As a result, the allocation string will be
replaced with the one associated with the group "pstn". This is the same
of doing <action application="brigde" data="Khomp/b0l0 + b1c38/... />.
In the second example, a context is also defined which can be used in
extensions.conf for inbound calls on that allocation string's range.

<!--
Section for configuring cadences used on FXS boards and the whole
channel (fast busy, ringback tones, etc).
-->
<cadences>
<!--
Default value for cadences. You may define your own cadences, and
also use them in the bridge arguments as "cadence=your_cadence_name".

 "0,0" means a continuous dialtone.

 (default as defined below)
 <param name="fast-busy" value="100,100" />
 <param name="ringback" value="1000,4000" />
 <param name="pbx-dialtone" value="1000,100" />

<!-- Section for configuring CALLERID's associated with FXS boards. -->
<fxs-branches>
<!--
In this section, you should define options using the following syntax:

'orig_prefix = serial number 0, serial number 1, ...'

ex: <param name="880" value="111,222"/>

In the example above (assuming KFXS-SPX boards 1234 and 4535), the
branches will be numbered from 800 to 829 in board 1234, and from
830 to 859 in board 4535.
-->
</fxs-branches>

<!-- Section for configuring FXS hotlines. -->
<fxs-hotlines>
<!--
In this section, you should define options using the following syntax:

'orig_prefix = destination_number'

ex: <param name="804" value="32332933" />

In the example above, the branch numbered 804 will call the number
3233-2933 (Khomp support number) every time the FXS branch goes off hook.
-->
</fxs-hotlines>

<!-- Section for configuring specific options for FXS branches. -->
<fxs-options>
<!--
In this section, you should define options using the following syntax:

orig_prefix = option1:value | option2:value | option3:value ...

ex: <param name="804" value="output-volume:+2" />

In the example above, the branch numbered 804 will have specific
configuration for default output volume set to +2.

Possible values to options is:
context, input-volume, output-volume, language,
accountcode, calleridnum, calleridname, flash-to-digits.
